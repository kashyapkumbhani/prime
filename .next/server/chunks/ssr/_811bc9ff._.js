It contains real booking details and PNR numbers but is not a paid ticket. Many embassies require proof of onward travel as part of the visa application process, and dummy tickets fulfill this requirement without the risk of purchasing expensive flights before your visa is approved."},{question:"Are your documents really accepted by embassies?",answer:"Yes, absolutely! Our documents are created in embassy-approved formats and contain real booking confirmations, PNR numbers, and reservation details. We've successfully served over 50,000 customers with a 98% visa success rate. Our team stays updated with embassy requirements to ensure all documents meet current standards."},{question:"How quickly can I get my documents?",answer:"Most documents are delivered within 15-30 minutes of order confirmation. For urgent requests, we offer express service with delivery in 5-15 minutes for an additional fee. Our automated systems work 24/7 to ensure fast processing and delivery."},{question:"What if my visa application gets rejected?",answer:"While we cannot guarantee visa approval (as this depends on various factors assessed by embassy officials), we do guarantee that our documents meet embassy requirements. If your visa is rejected due to issues with our documents specifically, we offer a full refund as per our money-back guarantee policy."}]},{title:"Flight Reservations",icon:l.Shield,faqs:[{question:"Do flight reservations contain real PNR numbers?",answer:"Yes, all our flight reservations contain genuine PNR (Passenger Name Record) numbers that can be verified directly with the airline. These are real reservations in the airline's system, though they are temporary and will expire after a specified period."},{question:"How long are flight reservations valid?",answer:"Flight reservations are typically valid for 48-72 hours, which is sufficient time for visa submission. If you need the reservation for a longer period, please contact our support team, and we can arrange extended validity for an additional fee."},{question:"Can I modify the flight details after booking?",answer:"Yes, minor modifications like dates or passenger names can be made within 24 hours of booking at no extra charge. For major changes like destinations or completely new itineraries, a new reservation may need to be created."},{question:"What airlines do you work with?",answer:"We work with major international airlines including Emirates, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, and many others. The specific airline will depend on your chosen route and availability."}]},{title:"Hotel Bookings",icon:m.Star,faqs:[{question:"Are hotel bookings real reservations?",answer:"Yes, all hotel bookings are genuine reservations with real confirmation numbers. They are made with actual hotels and can be verified through the hotel's booking system. These are temporary reservations that will be automatically cancelled after the specified period."},{question:"What types of hotels do you book?",answer:"We work with a wide range of accommodations from 3-star to 5-star hotels in major cities worldwide. We select reputable hotels that are commonly accepted by embassies and provide all necessary documentation for visa purposes."},{question:"Can I specify a particular hotel?",answer:"While we cannot guarantee a specific hotel due to availability and embassy requirements, you can mention preferences in the special requests section, and we'll do our best to accommodate them while ensuring the booking meets embassy standards."},{question:"How long are hotel bookings valid?",answer:"Hotel bookings are typically valid for 7-14 days, providing sufficient time for visa processing. The exact validity period will be clearly mentioned in your booking confirmation."}]},{title:"Travel Insurance",icon:k.Clock,faqs:[{question:"What coverage does your travel insurance provide?",answer:"Our travel insurance provides comprehensive coverage including medical expenses (up to €30,000 for basic, €100,000 for premium), emergency evacuation, trip cancellation, personal liability, and 24/7 emergency assistance. Premium plans also cover pre-existing conditions and adventure sports."},{question:"Is your travel insurance valid for Schengen visas?",answer:"Yes, our travel insurance meets all Schengen visa requirements including minimum coverage of €30,000 for medical expenses and emergency evacuation. The insurance certificate includes all required details and is accepted by Schengen country embassies."},{question:"Can I use this insurance for actual travel?",answer:"While our insurance certificates are primarily designed for visa applications, they do represent real insurance policies with actual coverage. However, we recommend purchasing comprehensive travel insurance from major providers for your actual travel needs."},{question:"What if I need to extend my travel insurance?",answer:"Insurance extensions are possible but must be arranged before the original policy expires. Contact our support team with your new travel dates, and we can arrange an extension for an additional fee."}]},{title:"Payment & Delivery",icon:i.MessageSquare,faqs:[{question:"What payment methods do you accept?",answer:"We accept all major credit and debit cards, UPI payments, net banking, and digital wallets.
